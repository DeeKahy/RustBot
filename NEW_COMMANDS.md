## Animation Technical Details

### Coinflip Animation Implementation
The coinflip command uses Discord's message editing API to create a smooth animation:

1. **Initial Message:** Sends a message saying the user is flipping a coin
2. **Animation Loop:** Edits the message 6 times with alternating coin emojis (ðŸª™/ðŸ”„)
3. **Timing:** Each frame displays for 300ms (0.3 seconds)
4. **Final Pause:** 500ms pause before revealing the result
5. **Result:** Final edit shows the actual coin flip outcome

**Total Animation Time:** ~2.3 seconds

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `tokio::time::sleep()` for precise timing
- Employs `poise::CreateReply::default().content()` for message editing
- Includes error handling for failed edits
- Generates the actual result before animation starts for consistency

The animation creates an engaging user experience while maintaining the integrity of the random coin flip result.

The commands are now ready to use!
